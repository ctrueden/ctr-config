This is my personal set of configuration files.

I make an effort to document why the configuration is the way it is.
I host the files on GitHub for my own convenience, and in case they
are useful to others, but of course there is NO WARRANTY ETC. ETC.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone this repository in your ```$HOME/code/ctrueden``` directory
2. From your ```$HOME``` directory, run the ```config-links.sh``` script

That's it!
